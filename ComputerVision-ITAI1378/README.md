# Computer Vision – ITAI 1378

This folder contains my projects, labs, and final demo for the ITAI 1378 Computer Vision course.

## 📘 Course Overview
In this course, I learned the foundations of computer vision, including image processing, classical ML techniques, CNNs, object detection, and Vision-Language Models. This folder showcases my hands-on work and understanding of these concepts.

## 📂 Included Project
### **VisionTalk: Image Captioning Program**
A Vision-Language AI system that generates natural-language captions from input images.

**Folder:** `VisionTalk-Image-Captioning/`  
This project demonstrates:
- Image preprocessing  
- Neural networks & transformers  
- Vision-Language Model (BLIP)  
- Generating natural-language descriptions  
- Using HuggingFace libraries
