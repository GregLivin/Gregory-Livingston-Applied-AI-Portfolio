📘 Computer Vision – ITAI 1378

This folder contains my work for the ITAI 1378 – Computer Vision course at Houston Community College.
Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with the foundations and advanced elements of computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning for image-based tasks.

🧠 What I Learned in This Course

This course covered a full pipeline of computer vision skills, including:

Image fundamentals (pixels, channels, color spaces)

Image processing and transformations

Classical machine learning for images

Neural networks for vision

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Transfer learning for vision models

Object detection workflows

Vision–Language Models (VLMs)

Image captioning and multimodal AI systems

These skills prepared me to complete the final project shown below.

⭐ Final Project – VisionTalk: Image Captioning System

Folder:
📁 VisionTalk-Image-Captioning/

My final project integrates all major concepts from the course into a single AI system that:

Accepts an input image

Processes it using a BLIP Vision–Language Model

Generates a natural-language caption describing the image

This showcases the combination of deep learning, transformers, and multimodal AI.
