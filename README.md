Gregory Livingston – Applied AI Portfolio

Houston Community College • Applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Program

About Me

My name is Gregory Livingston, and I am currently pursuing an A.A.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. I am passionate about creating intelligent robotic systems for land, sea, and air that can assist humans with tasks across many areas of life. My interests include advancing AI applications in fields such as surgical robotics, aerospace, and defense.

This portfolio highlights the experience and skills I gained throughout the ITAI 1378 Computer Vision course, along with the practical work I completed during the semester.

Technical Skills

Vision-Language Models

Computer Vision Techniques

Course Overview – ITAI 1378 (Computer Vision)

This course introduced the fundamentals of computer vision, with each module building toward more advanced understanding. I learned how to process and analyze images, train models, work with pre-trained networks, and create a small AI system that connects vision with language.

My main project for this course is included in the section below.

Featured Project
VisionTalk – Image Captioning System

This project focuses on teaching an AI model to describe images using natural language. I used a Vision-Language Model (BLIP) to link image features with text generation. The program accepts an image input and produces a descriptive caption based on its visual content.

This project demonstrates my learning in:

Image preprocessing

Neural network foundations

Transformer-based architectures

Vision-Language modeling
