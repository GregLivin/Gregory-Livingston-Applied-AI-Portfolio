⭐ Gregory Livingston – Applied AI Portfolio

Welcome to my Applied Artificial Intelligence portfolio. This repository showcases my work from the Applied AI & Robotics Program at Houston Community College, with a focus on computer vision, AI-powered systems, and practical machine learning applications.

👤 About Me

My name is Gregory Livingston, and I am currently pursuing an A.A.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.
I am passionate about developing intelligent robotic systems designed for land, sea, and air environments, supporting humans in completing tasks across all areas of life.

My interests include advancing AI applications in:

Surgical & medical robotics

Aerospace & autonomous flight systems

Defense, safety, and critical infrastructure technologies

I am also pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Technology (Mechatronics) to combine AI with engineering, hardware, and real-world robotics integration.
